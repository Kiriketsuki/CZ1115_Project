2276,Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier,"In creating this adaptation, the intent was to mainly adapt ""Birth"", ""Assassins"", ""The Mythos Cyborgs"" and ""Underground Empire of Yomi"", and have the four arcs make up the main composition of the series while adding a contemporary spin to the storyline. Yomi would also mark the end of the series, as Ishinomori had first intended.

To spread out the time between these four arcs and develop the characters further, newly-created stories were devised, along with loosely sourcing from stories in the Adventure King, Shojo Comic, and Weekly Shonen Sunday runs of the manga. The ""Vietnam"" arc would be re-purposed for a two-part mini-arc involving the fictional country of Muamba (along with providing a revised backstory for Cyborg 008), while the side-stories ""A Phantom Dog"" and ""The Aurora Strategy"" were also picked to be adapted.

As a way of keeping historical references in some backstories and as a way of creating a generation gap in the team, the creative team also introduced the concept of the ""First Generation Cyborgs"" and ""Second Generation Cyborgs"": 001-004 had actually been abducted and remodeled in the early 1960s, but were frozen for 40 years due to the technology not being up to par with what Black Ghost wanted. Some team members also underwent significant change to their personality as well (seen most significantly with Cyborgs 002 and 004).

With the collaboration of Kawagoe as director, as well as the series configuration writer Shinsuke Onishi and character designer Naoyuki Konno, various new guest characters were also devised for the series, drawing inspiration from other manga works by Shotaro Ishinomori. Other characters from the manga also underwent alteration, and the ""Mutant Warriors"" arc (episodes 39-42) was an anime-original creation loosely paying homage to some elements and characters from the ""Immigration"" and ""People Drifting Between Space and Time"" stories from the manga.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']",['JP'],ja,サイボーグ009 THE CYBORG SOLDIER,2003-06-30,2003,3380.0,68.96301775147928,1.754,2,6.5,3378.0,69.0,MANGA,False,69113,1678.0

The series has also been aired on TV in the United States, Italy, Spain and Germany.

In the Beginning marked the fourth time Bible stories formed the basis of a Japanese-animated television series, following the two Superbook series and The Flying House, which were made for Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network by Tatsunoko Production in the early 1980s.

In the Beginning features episodes devoted to most of the major Bible stories of the Old Testament, including the stories of the Creation, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, Abraham and Isaac, Joseph, Moses, David, and Solomon, with the final episode featuring the birth of Jesus Christ. As with the second Superbook series, some stories were stretched out over several episodes.

Sony's anime satellite channel, Animax also aired the series, both in Japan and on its various worldwide networks, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. The series is licensed for Region 1 release by Bandai Entertainment.

The series follows a teenage high school girl named Hitomi, who finds herself pulled from Earth to the planet Gaea when a boy named Van appears on the high school track while battling a dragon. In Gaea, she is caught in the middle of a war as the Zaibach Empire attempts to take over Gaea.

In addition, a second shōjo adaptation called Escaflowne—Energist's Memories was released as a single volume in 1997.

Kappei eventually moves in with Akane and her family after his parents (who are rarely around) leave for the United States. However, Kappei has an unusual rival for Akane's heart - Akane's dog, Seiichiro, who has often fantasized about marrying his owner and, resenting Kappei, immediately seeks to sabotage his relationship with Akane through various tricks.

The original series, produced in 1972, was eponymously named Kagaku Ninja Tai Gatchaman and is most well known to the English-speaking world as the adaptation titled Battle of the Planets. The series received additional English adaptations with G-Force: Guardians of Space and ADV Films' uncut 2005 release. Tatsunoko also uses the official translation Science Commando Gatchaman, as shown in numerous related products and media. Because the English-language versions are notoriously inconsistent not only with one another but also with the original Japanese series, viewers most familiar with the English versions often experience some confusion upon re-examining the series after a long hiatus.

The original 1972 Kagaku Ninja Tai Gatchaman series was followed by an animated film, two sequel series, Gatchaman II, and Gatchaman Fighter. In the 90's, episodes from both series were dubbed into English by Saban as Eagle Riders.
