Yomi would also mark the end of the series, as Ishinomori had first intended.

To spread out the time between these four arcs and develop the characters further, newly-created stories were devised, along with loosely sourcing from stories in the Adventure King, Shojo Comic, and Weekly Shonen Sunday runs of the manga. The ""Vietnam"" arc would be re-purposed for a two-part mini-arc involving the fictional country of Muamba (along with providing a revised backstory for Cyborg 008), while the side-stories ""A Phantom Dog"" and ""The Aurora Strategy"" were also picked to be adapted.

As a way of keeping historical references in some backstories and as a way of creating a generation gap in the team, the creative team also introduced the concept of the ""First Generation Cyborgs"" and ""Second Generation Cyborgs"": 001-004 had actually been abducted and remodeled in the early 1960s, but were frozen for 40 years due to the technology not being up to par with what Black Ghost wanted. Some team members also underwent significant change to their personality as well (seen most significantly with Cyborgs 002 and 004).

With the collaboration of Kawagoe as director, as well as the series configuration writer Shinsuke Onishi and character designer Naoyuki Konno, various new guest characters were also devised for the series, drawing inspiration from other manga works by Shotaro Ishinomori. Other characters from the manga also underwent alteration, and the ""Mutant Warriors"" arc (episodes 39-42) was an anime-original creation loosely paying homage to some elements and characters from the ""Immigration"" and ""People Drifting Between Space and Time"" stories from the manga.",1.754,6.5,2,2003.0,サイボーグ009thecyborgsoldier

It also contains a distinctive Metal soundtrack with electronica elements, often featuring electric guitar solos at dramatic moments.

Featured as a central plot element is the 'Shaft', a Mecha with a peculiar appearance.

The series is licensed for Region 1 release by Bandai Entertainment.

The series follows a teenage high school girl named Hitomi, who finds herself pulled from Earth to the planet Gaea when a boy named Van appears on the high school track while battling a dragon. In Gaea, she is caught in the middle of a war as the Zaibach Empire attempts to take over Gaea. Van, with aid from Allen, commands his mystical mech Escaflowne in the struggle to stop the Zaibach Empire. Hitomi's fortune telling powers blossom in Gaea as she becomes the key to awakening Escaflowne and to stopping Zaibach's plans.

While the anime series was in production, two very different manga retellings were also developed and released: a shōnen version of the story entitled The Vision of Escaflowne and a shōjo retelling titled Hitomi—The Vision of Escaflowne. In addition, a second shōjo adaptation called Escaflowne—Energist's Memories was released as a single volume in 1997. The story was novelized in a series of six light novels by Yumiko Tsukamoto, Hajime Yatate, and Shoji Kawamori.

His Achilles' heel is female undergarments; he has a particular interest in white panties, and is even more enthusiastic about joining the basketball team when he discovers that the team's female coach, Coach Natsu, wears white panties (although his inventive attempts to sneak a peek at said panties usually result in a physical beatdown from the hot-tempered coach). Eventually, Kappei's athletic prowess extends beyond basketball, and he tries out for - and excels at - every sport the school offers.

It is the fifth magical girl anime in history, and the fifth produced by the Toei Animation studio. While the show was fairly popular, it was not as popular as Toei's earlier magical-girl series, and is relatively obscure compared to its predecessors.

In addition to its success in Japan, Chappy has been dubbed into Italian, French, and Spanish and broadcast on TV in Italy and in various Latin American nations such as Mexico, Peru, or Chile. A manga adaptation of the story was drawn by Hideo Azuma, who later became more famous for his manga-turned-anime works, Little Pollon and Nanako SOS.

Chappy, along with other Toei magical girls such as Akko-chan, Sally, Cutie Honey, Megu-chan, Lunlun, and Lalabel, is a playable character in the Sony PlayStation game Majokko Daisakusen: Little Witching Mischiefs.
